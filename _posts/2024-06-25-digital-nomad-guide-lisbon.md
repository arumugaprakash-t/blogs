After spending three months working remotely from Lisbon, I can confidently say it's one of the best cities in Europe for digital nomads. Here's everything you need to know about making Portugal's capital your temporary home office.

## Why Lisbon Works for Remote Workers

### 1. Excellent Internet Infrastructure

One of the first concerns for any digital nomad is internet reliability. Lisbon delivers with:

- **Fiber optic coverage**: Available in most areas with speeds up to 1Gbps
- **Average speeds**: 50-100 Mbps in most coworking spaces and cafes
- **Mobile data**: Excellent 4G/5G coverage throughout the city
- **Backup options**: Multiple providers ensure redundancy

I consistently got 80+ Mbps at most locations, which was more than enough for video calls, file uploads, and streaming.

### 2. Thriving Coworking Scene

Lisbon has embraced the coworking culture with numerous excellent spaces:

**Second Home Lisboa** (Mercado da Ribeira)
- Beautiful design in a converted market
- €35/day, €280/month
- Great networking events

**Drivein** (Multiple locations)
- Modern facilities with 24/7 access
- €25/day, €200/month
- Strong focus on startups

**Cowork Central** (Príncipe Real)
- Boutique space with a local feel
- €20/day, €150/month
- Excellent coffee and community

### 3. Cost of Living

Compared to other Western European capitals, Lisbon is remarkably affordable:

| Expense | Monthly Cost (EUR) |
|---------|-------------------|
| Private room in shared apartment | €400-600 |
| Studio apartment | €600-900 |
| Coworking membership | €150-280 |
| Meals (eating out regularly) | €300-500 |
| Transportation | €40 |
| **Total** | **€1,290-2,320** |

## Best Neighborhoods for Digital Nomads

### Príncipe Real
My personal favorite for its central location and vibrant atmosphere:
- **Pros**: Trendy cafes, coworking spaces, excellent restaurants
- **Cons**: Can be touristy, slightly more expensive
- **Best for**: Young professionals who want to be in the heart of things

### Santos Design District
Perfect for creatives and design-focused nomads:
- **Pros**: Art galleries, design studios, riverside location
- **Cons**: Limited public transport options
- **Best for**: Designers, architects, creative professionals

### Cais do Sodré
Great for finance and tech workers:
- **Pros**: Business district, excellent transport links, modern apartments
- **Cons**: Less character than other neighborhoods
- **Best for**: Corporate remote workers, fintech professionals

## Tech Scene and Networking

Lisbon has a surprisingly robust tech ecosystem:

### Major Events

## Practical Tips for Getting Started
